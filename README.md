## Overview

This project demonstrates the foundational principles of web development. Using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity, I built a functional and visually appealing user interface that is fully responsive. This hands-on experience has been vital in my journey to create modern web applications.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript (jQuery)

### What I learned

This project has been vital to my development journey, as I've learned how to effectively manipulate elements using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
@media (max-width: 480px) {
  body {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
  }
  .container {
    width: 260px;
    margin-top: 200px;
  }

  .parent {
    width: 100vw;
  }

  .banner {
    width: 100vw;
  }

  .answer {
    width: 250px;
  }
}
```

```js
$(".plus").click(function () {
  var targetAnswer = $(this).closest(".question").next(".answer");

  $(".answer").not(targetAnswer).slideUp();

  $(".plus").not(this).attr("src", "./assets/images/icon-plus.svg");
});
```

### Continued development

I will continue to keep learning on how to manipulate complex element by using javaScript.
